# What is this

Hi! I'm a student from belgium and I am working on my pen testing. With this blog I wanted to share my road and experience in becoming a good pentester. Right now I am trying to solve as much boxes on TryHackMe.com.

My first real box to attack is the pickle rick box. First thing to do is to run an nmap scan on the box.
![nmap scan](https://github.com/Jorik-VanLooy/THM-blog/blob/THM_writeups/pickle-rick/nmap-scan-Pickle-rick.png)

The result as we can see is that it is an ubuntu box running a webserver on port 80. Let's see what this is all about.
